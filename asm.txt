MRS <Rn>, <Sreg>
Copies a special regsiter into a register

MSR <Sreg>, <Rn>
Copies a general purpose register into a special register

CMP <Rd>, <operand2>
Subtracts operand2f rom Rd and updates the flag
second operand can be a register with optional shit or a constant 

TST <Rd>, <operand2>
Computes the logical and between operand2 and Rd and updates the flag

# Flags are affected onlu if the suffix 'S' is appended to the instruction

ALU

ADD <Rd>, <Rn>, <Op2>
SUB
UDIV
SDIV
AND
ORR
XOR
NOT <Rd>, <Rn>

LSL
LSR
ROR

MOV to move data between registers

MOV <Rd>, #<constant> (16 bits)
MOV <Rd>, <Rm> {, shift}

shift can be

LSL #n (logical shift left)
LSR #n (logical shift right)

LDR{_, B, H} <Rd>, <addressing_mode>

To load constant

addressing_mode can be

[<Rn>, <offset>]{!}

if you add !, Rs is updated after the access

you can assign other names to registers with RN
name RN registerIndex

You can give a symbolic name to a numeric constant
name EQU expression

to declare constant, you can use DCB, DCW, DCD

B	to branch <label>
BX 	to branch a register
BL 	to branch and link <label>
BLX to branch and link a register

conditional operations based on flags:

EQ	        Z = 1	                Equal
NE	        Z = 0	                Not equal
CS or HS	C = 1	                Higher or same, unsigned
CC or LO	C = 0	                Lower, unsigned
MI	        N = 1	                Negative
PL	        N = 0	                Positive or zero
VS	        V = 1	                Overflow
VC	        V = 0	                No overflow
HI	        C = 1 and Z = 0	        Higher, unsigned
LS	        C = 0 or Z = 1	        Lower or same, unsigned
GE	        N = V	                Greater than or equal, signed
LT	        N != V	                Less than, signed
GT	        Z = 0 and N = V	        Greater than, signed
LE	        Z = 1 and N != V        Less than or equal, signed
AL	        Can have any value	    Always. This is the default when no suffix is specified.
